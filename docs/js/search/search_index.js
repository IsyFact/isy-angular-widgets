HttpInterceptor that adds http headers depending on the concrete OpenTracing implementation.\nThe OpenTracing Standard is currently not supported by the IsyFact software\nfactory and offers an alternative for the concept of the correlationId\n(See  IsyFact documentation)\nIn difference to the correlationId, the OpenTracing standard uses a trace- and a spanId.\n\n  traceId: This is an id that is assigned to a single request, job, or action. Something like each unique user initiated web request will have its own traceId.\n  spanId: Tracks a unit of work. Think of a request that consists of multiple steps. Each step could have its own spanId and be tracked individually.\n\n\n\nFor generating the id the crypto api\nof the webbrowsers is used.\n\n            \n\n\n            \n

neueste Node und Npm LTS Version installiert sein.\nAnschließend muss das Projekt aus GitHub bezogen werden\nExample :git clone https://github.com/IsyFact/isy-angular-widgets.git\ncd isy-angular-widgetDependencies Installieren\nVor der ersten Ausführung bzw. beim Ergänzen neuer Pakete muss das Projekt mit folgendem Befehl installiert werden.\nExample :npm installWidgets-Bibliothek lokal an ein neues Projekt anbinden\n\nÖffnen isy-angular-widgets\nIm root directory \"npm run build:widgets_lib\" ausführen\nUmgehen auf Pfad \"/isy-angular-widgets/dist/isy-angular-widgets\" und Pfad kopieren\nNeues Angular-Projekt Version 15 neu anlegen (npm install wird ausgeführt)\nUmgehen auf root directory und Ausführung von \"npm add /pathToWidgets/isy-angular-widgets/dist/isy-angular-widgets\" (kopierter Pfad von Schritt 3)\nIm Modul, wo die eine ausgewählte Komponente z.B. Input-Char verwendet werden soll, müssen folgende Module unter \"modules\" hinzugefügt werden: BrowserAnimationsModule und je nach Fall vlt. auch BrowserModule oder/auch CommonModule\nInnerhalb der Datei angular.json, unter: architect->build->options muss folgendes property hinzugefügt werden: \"preserveSymlinks\": true - Hintergrund: Bei Windows entsteht oft wegen den Pfaden ein Fehler und es tritt eine Fehlermeldung bezüglich inject() auf. Unter Linux gibt es keine Probleme\nApplikation starten\nAus isy-angular-widgets ein beliebiges Widget integrieren\n\nDemo-Anwendung starten\nNeben den Widgets können in der Demo-Anwendung praktische Beispiele für die Umsetzung von Styleguide-Patterns oder querschnittlichen Aspekten betrachtet werden.\nDie Demo-Anwendung kann mit folgendem Befehl gestartet werden. \nExample :$ npm run startPrettier für Demo-Anwendung und Widgets-Bibliothek ausführen\nZur Überprüfung der Demo-Anwendung und der Widgets-Bibliothek auf Code-Formatierungsfehler mithilfe von Prettier, kann folgender Befehl ausgeführt werden.\nExample :$ npm run prettier:checkUm Code-Formatierungsfehler innerhalb der Demo-Anwendung und der Widgets-Bibliothek mithilfe von Prettier zu beheben, kann folgender Befehl ausgeführt werden.\nExample :$ npm run prettier:fixE2E-Tests für Demo-Anwendung ausführen\nFür die Demo-Anwendung wurden exemplarisch einige E2E-Tests mit dem Framework TestCafe umgesetzt.\nUm die Tests auszuführen, muss zunächst die Demo-Anwendung gestartet werden (siehe oben).\nFür die Ausführung der Tests wird der Webbrowser Chrome benötigt, alternativ kann das e2e Skript angepasst und dort ein anderer Browser eingetragen werden.\nDie Tests werden mit folgendem Befehlt gestartet.\nExample :$ npm run e2ePrimeNG-Designer\nDie globalen Styles (isyfact-primeng-bootstrap-light.css) werden vom PrimeNG-Theme-Designer generiert.\nAls Basis-Theme wird Bootstrap Light verwendet.\nFür das aktuelle Theme wurden folgende Einstellungen im PrimeNG-Theme-Designer verwenden:\n\n\n\nEinstellungen\nWert\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nFont Family\nBundesSans,'Liberation Sans',sans-serif\n\n\nText\n73, 80, 87\n\n\nSecondary Text\n73, 80, 87\n\n\nBorder Radius\n0px\n\n\nDisabled Opacity\n0.75\n\n\nPalette\n\n\n\nPrimary\n69, 72, 77\n\n\nPrimary Dark\n137, 144, 154\n\n\nPrimary Darker\n137, 144, 154\n\n\nHighlight Background\n204, 227, 236\n\n\nText on Highlight\n73, 80, 87\n\n\nHover Background\n204, 227, 236\n\n\nForms\n\n\n\nFocus Border\n204, 227, 236\n\n\nButtons\n\n\n\nSecondary Background\n69, 72, 77\n\n\n\nErstellen von Releases\nReleases werden mithilfe einer GitHub Action erzeugt, welche immer dann ausgeführt wird, wenn ein Tag mit einer gültigen Versionsnummer nach Semver erstellt wird.\nDiese Versionsnummer wird dann automatisch in die package.json der gebauten Bibliothek ausgetauscht.\nDas bedeutet, die Versionsnummer muss nicht manuell in der package.json des Projekts gepflegt werden (Dort steht einfach 0.0.0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nExample :                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
